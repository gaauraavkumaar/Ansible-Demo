# ðŸš€ Ansible Demo: Docker + NGINX on GCP VM

## âœ… Steps Performed

1. Created a VPC named `gaurav-vpc`
2. Created a subnet named `gaurav-subnet` under the VPC
3. Created a VM named `gaurav-ansible-vm` inside the subnet using GCP CLI
4. Verified that Python3 is pre-installed on the VM
5. Installed Ansible on my local machine (Mac)
6. Created an `inventory.ini` file with the VMâ€™s external IP and SSH details
7. Wrote an Ansible playbook (`setup.yml`) to:
   - Install Docker on the VM
   - Run an NGINX container on port 80
8. Allowed HTTP (80) and SSH (22) traffic using firewall rules
9. Ran the Ansible playbook from my local machine using:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini setup.yml
10.	Verified that the NGINX container is running on the VM
11.	Accessed the NGINX welcome page via the VMâ€™s external IP in the browser
12.	Pushed the Ansible project to this GitHub repository
